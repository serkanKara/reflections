When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    If I need to cooperate with people from different locations. And also having a remote repository is safer than only storing the code on my computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    I wouldn't want to send everything to the master.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forking is done on Github to copy somebody else's codes to your own github repository.
    Clones are done to copy a repository from github to your local.
    Branching is done to create a copy of your code to continue revising without touching the original copy.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

	When pulling and pushing, it probably makes things more easy.    

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Maybe emails? It would be really hard to exchange codes and spot the changes in them.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    When you are not sure your planned changes are appropriate for the master.
