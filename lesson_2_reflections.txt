What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	You probably start tracking the files in that directory by Git. Because we want to continue our work with a version control system, like Git, for safety.
	
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	This is where we organize, categorize our changed files. We can group the files for a single commit.
