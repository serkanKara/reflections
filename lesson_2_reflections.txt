What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	You probably start tracking the files in that directory by Git. Because we want to continue our work with a version control system, like Git, for safety.
	
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	This is where we organize, categorize our changed files. We can group the files for a single commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	It is subjective. It depends on my rationale whether my changes can be grouped into one.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
	When trying different versions of the main code. You can go to a certain branch without effecting the main code.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
	Visualizing helps me understand what is going on.
